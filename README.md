üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Python Example

from flask import Flask, render_template
from cyberbot import Bot
import time

app = Flask(__name__)

bot = Bot(app=app, api_key="PRO123", bot_env=True)
key = bot.generate_key()
bot.encrypt_app(key)
bot.keep_host_alive(url="http://127.0.0.1:8000", interval=60)

db_pass = bot.get_secret("DB_PASS")
@app.route("/")
def home():
    print(db_pass)
    return f"Hello World! data pass: {db_pass}"
    
@app.route("/wow")
def wow():
  return render_template("index.html")
    
@bot.lock_route("/test", password="Alextestbot")
def test():
    return "Hello"

# Run the Flask app
bot.run(port=5000)

Browser Example

browers sdk is used to decrept encrypted app

<script src="https://server-cdns-org.onrender.com/cdn/libs/cyberbot.js"></script>

<pre id="output" style="
  background:#111; 
  color:#0f0; 
  padding:1em; 
  border-radius:8px; 
  font-family:monospace; 
  white-space:pre-wrap; 
  word-break:break-word;
"></pre>

<script>
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => {
  const bot = new CyberBot("P+HWD8MNddNY+aDSpTQHPzWfdgnVoLWWGhpJs4fOEKQ=");
  const out = document.getElementById("output");

  const data = await bot.fetch("http://127.0.0.1:5000/");

  if (data) {
    if (data.type === "text") {
      out.textContent = data.content;
    } else if (data.type === "html"){
      out.innerHTML = data.content;
    }
  }
});
</script>

üîê BotEnv ‚Äì Secure Environment Upgrade

BotEnv is a secure upgrade to the traditional .env file system. Instead of storing plain-text secrets in .env, CyberBot automatically encrypts and protects environment variables with instance-bound vaults.

üöÄ How It Works

1. Initialization

When your app starts, CyberBot checks for a .env file.

If found, it generates an app-encrypted key and creates a secure vault.

The vault replaces your normal .env cyberbot.env, and the secrets are decrypted only in memory, use get_secret("actual_key") to access specific stored data



2. Instance-Bound Security

Each vault is tied to a single runtime instance.

If the app restarts, crashes, or is killed, the existing vault becomes invalid and cannot be reused.

This means stealing an encrypted .env file from disk is useless outside its original runtime.



3. Automatic Protection

On restart, if an old encrypted vault is detected, BotEnv skips it and shows a clear message:

[CyberBot] BotEnv skipped: existing encrypted environment is invalid for this runtime. 
Vaults are tied to a single app instance and cannot be reused after a restart or crash.

A fresh secure environment is generated each time.



4. No Manual Decryption

Developers never handle encryption keys directly.

CyberBot manages the lifecycle of the vault automatically.




‚úÖ Why BotEnv?

Protects sensitive API keys, tokens, and credentials.

Prevents stolen .env files from being reused in another environment.

Works seamlessly with CyberBot ‚Äî no config needed.

Only available to Pro plan users for maximum security.
